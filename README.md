BSM Reborn Theme

This is a gray GTK2/GTK3 theme for MATE. It was created to be an unofficial continuation of the BSM Simple theme. The BSM Simple theme was never updated for GTK3 compatibility, so this theme is intended to be a continuation.

This theme combines elements of BSM Simple, its Metacity theme, but built on top of a base of the Ambiant-MATE theme with the green elements changed to Gray. This should give the theme a consistent look for all GTK2 and GTK3 applications.

To install, clone or download this repository, and place the theme in your ~/.themes directory. If your ~/.themes directory doesn't exist, create it.

Help is needed! This theme is not complete. Although it is quite a bit along, there are still some elements that need tweaking. This is my first GTK theme ever, so all help is appreciated.

Note: This theme looks really good when used with the Moka Minimal icon theme!
